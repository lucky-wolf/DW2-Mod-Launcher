# Focus

What's been accomplished on this branch so far - read by `scripts/open-pr.py` as the PR description
(it falls back to the branch's commit subjects when this is empty).

Format: one `- ` line per finished piece of work, below the `---`: a short, user-facing one-liner.
Add the line when you actually finish the work (humans and AI agents alike) rather than trying to
reconstruct it right before opening the PR. Fold several small related lines into one when a theme is done.

`scripts/new-branch.py` empties the list when it creates a new branch.

- Publish dialog proposes the next patch version on updates, writes it on accept, and rolls it back if the publish does not happen.
- After publishing, warn if Steam did not apply the chosen visibility.
